# üè™ Emoji Mart desktop popup

Modern emoji picker popup app for desktop, based on the [Emoji Mart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart) web component.

Built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [Solid JS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). 

Inspired from [github.com/Simon-Laux/tauri-emoji-mart-app](https://github.com/Simon-Laux/tauri-emoji-mart-app), difference are that we use Solid JS instead of React, the title bar is gone, window size has been improved, and the window pops in the middle of the screen.

Recommended IDE Setup: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

### üß∂ Install

```bash
yarn
```

### üõ©Ô∏è Run

In development mode, with automatic reload when the code changes:

```bash
yarn tauri dev
```

> To see logs and debug: right click on the app window, and select `Inspect Element`

### üì¶Ô∏è Package

Build an `.AppImage` and `.deb` packages (or `.dmg`/`.exe` depending on your OS):

```bash
yarn tauri build
```

On Linux, install the previously built `EmojiMart.AppImage` as desktop app:

```bash
./install.sh local
```

### üè∑Ô∏è New release

To publish a new release, follow this process:

1. Make sure you have changed the version in: `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `tauri.conf.json`

2. Update the `yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json` (required for flatpak build):

   ```bash
   yarn
   npm i --save-exact
   ```

3. Merge the `main` branch to the `release` branch, and push the `release` branch to GitHub
4. A [GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/vemonet/EmojiMart/actions/workflows/release.yml) will automatically build the artefacts for the different platforms, and create a draft release
5. Finally you can review the draft on the [**Releases** page](https://github.com/vemonet/EmojiMart/releases), generate the Release note, and publish it in 2 clicks

## üìãÔ∏è Todo

- [ ] Improve popup speed: 
  - [ ] Calling the AppImage creates a new window, instead of reusing open processes
  - [x] Checkout tauri docs to run in the background: https://tauri.app/fr/v1/guides/features/system-tray/#preventing-the-app-from-closing
  - [ ] Try to not close the window (hide?), and bring it back to the front instead of creating a new window when the AppImage is called?
  - [ ] Look into tauri global shortcut to hide/show: https://tauri.app/fr/v1/api/js/globalshortcut/
- [ ] Closing the window when clickout with the `WINDOW_BLUR` event is also triggered when running in development, which is not convenient for inspecting the element
- [ ] Build Flatpak: 
  - [ ] Example: https://github.com/hadess/flathub/tree/d4b53ff829e0917c5129294132f619e5f12d337c
